# You got r00t!

# I hope you had fun hacking this box, I tried to design this VM to be (a bit)
different
# by having newer or not-so-common technologies and a minumal linux install.
#
# Please don't post the content below on Social Networks to let others do the

#
# As you know by now, the entry point is an XXE vulnerability that can be exploited
by
# modifying an image. After that you can enumerate a user and the linux version to

# that it uses a different file in its home dir.
# To read this you used a suspicious file permission on certain text editor.
# At least that's how it was planned ;)
# Let me know if you got here using another method!
